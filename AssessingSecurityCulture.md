# Assessing Security Culture

1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.
- Phishing attacks, Malware attacks, and hardware/data theft.

2. Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?
- It’d be preferred for employees to be mindful of phishing attempts, any suspicious links that may be malicious and keeping up to date on their phone software, which may include the latest security updates.

3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?
- Hiring pentesters to send fake phishing emails to see who is falling for the spam emails, and putting them through a security training.

4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?
- Anywhere from 0 percent to 5 percent.

**Step 2: Involve the Right People**

5. Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?
- The IT department, HR department, the CEO, the entire upper class of administration, and the Security Training department need to be involved.
- The IT departments role and responsibility is to ensure that employees are up to date on security trainings for potential phishing attacks or other infiltration methods.For example, the IT department may be the ones to send out fake phishing emails to test employees on their knowledge from their trainings assessed by the Security Training Department.
- The HR department's role and responsibility is to hire qualified cybersecurity analysts (for example, pentesters)  to ensure the safety of the company's data.
- The CEO’s role and responsibility is to overlook the entire upper class of administration and ensure that they are taking the necessary safety protocols to ensure the safety of the company's confidential data.
- The Security Training Department’s role and responsibility is to keep employees up to date on security trainings that involve potential cybersecurity threats to the company and how to prevent such malicious attacks from happening in the first place.These could go as far as social engineering attacks such as tailgating, to any sort of malware or malicious attack on company servers.

**Step 3: Training Plan**
6. Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:
How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)

- Trainings will be set up via Zoom calls, 
- Powerpoint presentations in person, and emails. 
- Every forty-five days there will be a Zoom call from the Security Training Department to ensure that employees are up-to-date on current security protocols. This will ensure that everyone in the company is on the same page. The topics that will be covered are the different methods of attack that can be presented upon a company's data infrastructure. For example, the topic of phishing emails will be presented, and employees will be given a test or small quiz that requires them to implement what they learned from the Security Trainings. These quizzes and tests may be from previous trainings, this way you can ensure that employees don’t forget certain methods of being possibly attacked. The other topics that will be covered are protection of hardware and personal devices. Since employees are using their personal devices, it is critical that they understand the severity of risk that may come with exposing private company data on their own cell phones, laptops, tablets, etc. They will be trained on how to keep data confidential and secure on their own devices by not downloading third-party apps or clicking any suspicious links in their emails. Since company given email addresses will be used for the business, it is critical that employees do not give this email address out for personal use or any other reason besides work. If a thief were to get their hands on an employee’s personal device, it doesn’t only expose their private information, but it may expose their employer’s confidential data. For example, if someone from the Human Resources Department had their phone stolen, that phone may have contained their work email and access to certain information on employees such as personal addresses, health benefits, banking information, employment history, social security numbers, and anything else that may be deemed as confidential and personal. 
- The way the effectiveness of these training sessions will be measured, is by different methods. For example, a pentester may be hired to send out “fake phishing emails” to every single employee in the company, or a select few, and find out who is clicking on the links. Another way is by testing employees in a short quiz after trainings, or at any given time to ensure that they implemented what they were taught in the trainings.
